# Finite-Element-Analysis
Projects for Methods and Techniques of Finite Element Analysis. University of California, Berkeley, Spring 2018. 


• Project 1: Programmatically solving a boundary value problem using FEM, with required error tolerance <br />
• Project 2: Using Poisson's equation and FEM to solve for the flow and pressure field around an airfoil <br />
• Project 3: Solve a wave equation subject to initial and boundary conditions; with and without mass lumping <br />
• Project 4: For the Navier-Stokes equation; measure the velocity field, compute the pressure field. Then measure the blood flow velocity inside the human heart and use flow field to compute the pressure distribution inside the heart to aid diagnosis of cardiac disease
